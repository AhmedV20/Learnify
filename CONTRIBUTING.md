# Contributing to Learnify

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Learnify. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Learnify Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AhmedV20/Learnify/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/AhmedV20/Learnify/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Read the [documentation](README.md)** first to verify that the functionality doesn't already exist.
- **Open a new issue** and describe your idea.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `develop`.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-amazing-feature`.
4.  **Make your changes**.
5.  **Test your changes**.
6.  **Push** to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-amazing-feature`.
7.  **Open a Pull Request** targeting the `develop` branch of the original repository.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).

### C# Coding Style

- Follow Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
- Use `Async` suffix for asynchronous methods.
- Interface names should start with `I`.
